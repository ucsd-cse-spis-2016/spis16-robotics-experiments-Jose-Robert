# Brief Description

We have multiple ideas as of right now. We hope to play an audio clip of "Cool beans," from hot rod, as well as be able to cursively draw the phrase. For our challenge, we hope to find another pair to "joust" against. Using servos, we hope to create arms that can whack at the other robot and complete some goal, whether this be knocking something off of the opposing robot or flipping it, etc. 
In the event of no other pairs wanting to joust, we might create a robot that can compete in a series of games: for instance shooting hoops or catapult. 


We need help and guidance in choosing a project from one of the above. 

Wtih input from Diba we have finally decided on what our project will be. We will be doing an obstacle avoiding and image recognizing robot.

Although not particularly smooth, we have a robot that is capable going through a simple course wich wil avoid walls and other objects. One thing that we have to work on is adding a piece of code that  will aid the robot when its stuck in a "funnel," aka blocked on all sides. After that, we will move on to image processing and make the camera recognize colors and react to each in a specific manner.
