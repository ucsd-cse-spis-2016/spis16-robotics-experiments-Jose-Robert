# Brief Description

We have multiple ideas as of right now. We hope to play an audio clip of "Cool beans," from hot rod, as well as be able to cursively draw the phrase. For our challenge, we hope to find another pair to "joust" against. Using servos, we hope to create arms that can whack at the other robot and complete some goal, whether this be knocking something off of the opposing robot or flipping it, etc. 
In the event of no other pairs wanting to joust, we might create a robot that can compete in a series of games: for instance shooting hoops or catapult. 


We need help and guidance in choosing a project from one of the above.
